# Memento
### The Time Budget API

> [Memento](https://continuumlabs.dev) is a fully-customizable time budget framework which is used as the fundamental layer for project management in Project Atlas by Continuum. This API can be used within applications as a personal goal-structuring system, a basis for mentors to assemble a curriculum, and an enterprise scheduling agent for large and small organizations.

The Memento interface is based on [timeblocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeblocking). These blocks can be broken down and strung together as needed in order to visualize a 24-hour period or a 10-year bird's eye view, with the added feature of *legacy* goals to account for past and future milestones which cannot be easily confined to a timeline (like a bucket list). It also utilizes a [checklist system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checklist) designed to help individuals and groups track their retention and progress, with the **principle of accountability** as the API's North Star.

Memento is designed to correct [resistance](https://stevenpressfield.com/books/the-war-of-art/), a concept described in Steven Pressfield's *The War of Art*. The developers of this API know that maintaining consistency when pursuing a goal isn't easy, and we did not forget to consider these common roadblocks in our design.

In summary, the Memento API is a foolproof and highly-adaptable template for structuring practices, goals, and deadlines, and for receiving real-time feedback via the application in use.
